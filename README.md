STRIDE is an Online Store 2.0 theme designed around how sneaker and footwear brands actually sell: colorway variants, seasonal drops, and product craft detail. It ships with several sections you won't find in a general-purpose theme:

- **Colorway-switching hero** — clicking a swatch instantly swaps the hero image or video and updates the call-to-action link, with every colorway preloaded so the switch never waits on the network.
- **Drop countdown** — a countdown section for real, merchant-set release dates (no simulated urgency).
- **Shoppable lookbook** — tagged hotspots over editorial photography, fully keyboard-operable.
- **Product anatomy** — a horizontal scroll-through of a product's construction and materials.

Built from scratch on Shopify's `skeleton-theme` scaffold, following its conventions (`{% stylesheet %}` / `{% javascript %}` tags, CSS variables for single-property settings, CSS classes for multi-property settings, no build step).

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the latest Shopify CLI installed:

- [Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/shopify-cli) – helps you download, upload, preview themes, and streamline your workflows

If you use VS Code:

- [Shopify Liquid VS Code Extension](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/tools/shopify-liquid-vscode) – provides syntax highlighting, linting, inline documentation, and auto-completion specifically designed for Liquid templates

### Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/2tees-cloud/STRIDE-Shopify-Theme-Store.git
```

### Preview

Preview this theme using Shopify CLI:

```bash
shopify theme dev
```

## Theme architecture

```bash
.
├── assets          # Stores static assets (CSS, JS, images, fonts, etc.)
├── blocks          # Reusable, nestable, customizable UI components
├── config          # Global theme settings and customization options
├── layout          # Top-level wrappers for pages (layout templates)
├── locales         # Translation files for theme internationalization
├── sections        # Modular full-width page components
├── snippets        # Reusable Liquid code or HTML fragments
└── templates       # Templates combining sections to define page structures
```

To learn more, refer to the [theme architecture documentation](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture).

### Templates

[Templates](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/templates#template-types) control what's rendered on each type of page in a theme. STRIDE ships [JSON templates](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/templates/json-templates) for every required Theme Store page type, so merchants can customize each one from the theme editor without touching code.

### Sections

[Sections](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/sections) are Liquid files that allow you to create reusable modules of content that can be customized by merchants. They can also include blocks which allow merchants to add, remove, and reorder content within a section.

Sections are made customizable by including a `{% schema %}` in the body. For more information, refer to the [section schema documentation](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/sections/section-schema).

### Blocks

[Blocks](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/blocks) let developers create flexible layouts by breaking down sections into smaller, reusable pieces of Liquid. Each block has its own set of settings, and can be added, removed, and reordered within a section.

Blocks are made customizable by including a `{% schema %}` in the body. For more information, refer to the [block schema documentation](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/architecture/blocks/theme-blocks/schema).

## Schemas

When developing components defined by schema settings, this theme follows these conventions:

- **Single property settings**: For settings that correspond to a single CSS property, use CSS variables:

  ```liquid
  <div class="collection" style="--gap: {{ block.settings.gap }}px">
    ...
  </div>

  {% stylesheet %}
    .collection {
      gap: var(--gap);
    }
  {% endstylesheet %}

  {% schema %}
  {
    "settings": [{
      "type": "range",
      "label": "gap",
      "id": "gap",
      "min": 0,
      "max": 100,
      "unit": "px",
      "default": 0,
    }]
  }
  {% endschema %}
  ```

- **Multiple property settings**: For settings that control multiple CSS properties, use CSS classes:

  ```liquid
  <div class="collection {{ block.settings.layout }}">
    ...
  </div>

  {% stylesheet %}
    .collection--full-width {
      /* multiple styles */
    }
    .collection--narrow {
      /* multiple styles */
    }
  {% endstylesheet %}

  {% schema %}
  {
    "settings": [{
      "type": "select",
      "id": "layout",
      "label": "layout",
      "values": [
        { "value": "collection--full-width", "label": "t:options.full" },
        { "value": "collection--narrow", "label": "t:options.narrow" }
      ]
    }]
  }
  {% endschema %}
  ```

## CSS & JavaScript

For CSS and JavaScript, this theme uses the [`{% stylesheet %}`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/liquid/tags#stylesheet) and [`{% javascript %}`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/liquid/tags/javascript) tags. They can be included multiple times, but the code will only appear once.

### `critical.css`

STRIDE explicitly separates essential CSS necessary for every page into a dedicated `critical.css` file.

## Design & implementation notes

The full design specification and phase-by-phase implementation plans for this theme live in [`docs/superpowers/`](./docs/superpowers/) — useful background for anyone continuing development, including which requirements are code-level (covered here) versus business/legal steps required before an actual Theme Store submission (trademark clearance, demo store setup, support documentation).
